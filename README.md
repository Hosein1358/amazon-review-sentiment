## ðŸš€ How to Run

The project is executed from the command line and requires 4 input arguments:

1- train_data â†’ path to the training dataset

2- test_data â†’ path to the testing dataset

3- model â†’ the model to use for sentiment analysis. Options include:

	lr â†’ Logistic Regression
	svm â†’ Support Vector Machine
	rf â†’ Random Forest
	gb â†’ Gradient Boosting
	nb â†’ Naive Bayes
	lstm â†’ LSTM Neural Network

4- output_name â†’ name of the output file (default: results.csv)

Example:

```bash
python script.py data/train.csv data/test.csv lr results/result
```


This command trains a **Logistic Regression** model on `train.csv`, evaluates it on `test.csv`, and saves the predictions to `results` folder.
